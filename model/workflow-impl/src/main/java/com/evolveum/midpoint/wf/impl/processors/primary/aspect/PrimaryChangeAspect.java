/**
 *
 * Change aspect deals with a given (elementary) kind of primary-stage change. Examples of change aspects:
 *  - AddRoleAssignmentAspect
 *  - CreateUserAspect
 *  - ChangeAttributeXAspect (X is an attribute of a user)
 *  - ...
 *
 * Change aspect plays a role on these occasions:
 * 1) When a change arrives - change aspect tries to recognize whether the change
 *    contains relevant delta(s); if so, it prepares instruction(s) to start related workflow approval process(es).
 * 2) When a process instance finishes, change aspect:
 *     - modifies the delta(s) related to particular process instance and passes them along, to be executed,
 *     - provides a list of approvers that is to be stored in modified object's metadata.
 * 3) When a user wants to work on his task, the change aspect prepares a form to be presented to the user.
 * 4) When a user asks about the state of process instance(s), the change aspect prepares that part of the
 *    answer that is specific to individual process.
