/**
 * A change processor can be viewed as a kind of framework supporting customer-specific
 * workflow code. Individual change processors are specialized in their areas, allowing
 * customer code to focus on business logic with minimal effort.
 *
 * The name "change processor" is derived from the fact that primary purpose of this
 * framework is to process change requests coming from the model.
 *
 * TODO find a better name
 *
 * However, a change processor has many more duties, e.g.
 *
 * (1) recognizes the instance (instances) of given kind of change within model operation context,
 * (2) processes the result of the workflow process instances when they are finished,
 * (3) presents (externalizes) the content of process instances to outside world: to the GUI, auditing, and notifications.
 *
 * Currently, there are the following change processors implemented or planned:
 * - PrimaryChangeProcessor: manages approvals of changes of objects (in model's primary stage)
 * - GeneralChangeProcessor: manages any change, as configured by the system engineer/administrator
